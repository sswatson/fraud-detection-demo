    # Simple Features

    ## Computing the Features in Snowflake

    As a starting point, let's build a machine learning model using simple summary statistics from the `voc`, `sms`, and `app` tables. We will use the following features:

    - **outgoing_call_count**: The number of calls placed by the user.

    - **incoming_call_count**: The number of calls received by the user.

    - **outgoing_text_count**: The number of phone numbers to which a user has made voice calls.

    - **incoming_text_count**: The number of phone numbers from which a user has received voice calls.

    - **callbacks**: The number of phone numbers that a user has both received a voice call from and later called back.

    - **textbacks**: The number of phone numbers that a user has both received a text message from and later texted back.

    These features are all simple enough that we can calculate them relatively easily in SQL. The query below (collapsed because it is quite long!) materializes a feature table:
    """

    with st.expander("View SQL query for simple features:"):
        st.code(simple_feature_query)

    """
    Here's what the first few rows look like:
    """

    sql_query(conn, "SELECT * FROM simple_features LIMIT 5;")

    """

    ### Training the Model

    Let's train a baseline machine learning model using the features computed above. We can do this using *Snowpark*, which provides Python support inside Snowflake:
    """

    with st.expander("View Snowpark Python machine-learning code:"):
        st.code(snowpark_simple, "python")

    """
    ### Model Results

    The results of the model on the test set are as shown:
