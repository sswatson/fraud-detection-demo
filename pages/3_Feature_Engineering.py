# Feature Engineering

The `user` table, which contains the column indicating whether each user is a frauster or not, has very little information that would likely be useful for detecting fraud:
"""

sql_query(conn, """SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 5;""")


"""
However, we can supplement the existing features by computing aggregate statistics from the other three tables. For example, for each user we can calculate:

- **distinct_outgoing_text_count**: The number of unique phone numbers to which a user has sent text messages.

- **distinct_incoming_call_count**: The number of unique phone numbers from which a user has received voice calls.

- **distinct_outgoing_call_count**: The number of unique phone numbers to which a user has made voice calls.

- **distinct_callbacks**: The number of unique phone numbers that a user has both received a call from and later called back.

- **distinct_incoming_text_count**: The number of unique phone numbers from which a user has received text messages.

- **distinct_textbacks**: The number of unique phone numbers that a user has both received a text message from and later texted back.

We can calculate these quantities using SQL queries. First, we create new tables that represent sender and recipient in different columns:
"""

st.code("""
CREATE TABLE calls AS
    SELECT phone_no_m AS sender, opposite_no_m AS recipient, start_datetime AS timestamp FROM voc WHERE calltype_id = 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT opposite_no_m AS sender, phone_no_m AS recipient, start_datetime AS timestamp FROM voc WHERE calltype_id = 2;

CREATE TABLE texts AS
    SELECT phone_no_m AS sender, opposite_no_m AS recipient, request_datetime AS timestamp FROM sms WHERE calltype_id = 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT opposite_no_m AS sender, phone_no_m AS recipient, request_datetime AS timestamp FROM sms WHERE calltype_id = 2;
""", "sql")

"""
Populating these two tables is an important step because otherwise the complexity associated with handling the different `calltype_id` values would otherwise be pushed into the queries below, making them significantly more difficult to read and understand.

Now we can use SQL to calculate the statistics described above:
