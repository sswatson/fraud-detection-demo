*Note: the introduction below should be wordsmithed at a later stage . This is GPT-generated placeholder to convey the gist.*

In an increasingly digital world, the menace of fraud has grown exponentially, leading to significant financial losses and numerous other non-monetary impacts. In 2021, the total global loss due to fraud was approximately $40 billion.

In November 2022, people in the U.S. received over 47 billion spam texts. Beyond the considerable financial losses, fraud also results in a number of other significant impacts. Victims often experience great dissatisfaction, a sense of violation, and loss of trust in institutions. They may also lose substantial time in efforts to resolve the fraudulent issues. The increasing need for solutions is clear.

This app will explain how telecommunications companies can leverage cloud database technologies like Snowflake and RelationalAI to identify fraudulent actors.
